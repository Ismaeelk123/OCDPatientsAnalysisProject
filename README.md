# OCD Patients Project

Welcome to my first data analysis project! This repository combines SQL and Power BI to explore and analyse a dataset of OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) patients. This project marks the beginning of my self-teaching journey in data analytics.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase my learning in:

SQL: Querying and transforming data.

Power BI: Visualising insights from the data.

The dataset contains anonymised information on OCD patients, focusing on aspects such as demographics, symptoms, and treatment progress.

Tools Used

SQL: Used to clean, filter, and transform the dataset to prepare it for analysis.

Power BI: Used to create interactive dashboards for data visualisation and insight discovery.

Key Insights

Through this project, I:

Wrote SQL queries to clean and structure raw data.

Created calculated fields to derive additional insights.

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualise patient trends and patterns.

Lessons Learned

This project helped me:

Understand the end-to-end data analysis process.

Apply SQL to manipulate and analyse data.

Build dynamic and user-friendly dashboards in Power BI.

Next Steps

I plan to:

Dive deeper into data modelling and advanced Power BI techniques.

Work on more complex datasets and projects to enhance my skills.

Thank you for checking out my first project!
